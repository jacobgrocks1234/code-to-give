# Morgan Stanley, Code2give Hackathon

This is a desktop application prototype developed for the **Make a Wish** organization as part of the Morgan Stanley Hackathon. The app aims to improve communication between wish recipients and **Make a Wish** Ambassadors, particularly in remote areas where response delays may occur.

The completed application utilizes APIs for text messages, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps to ensure that wish messages reach the recipients even when offline. Also wish recipients can ask any online volunteer question, if the wish ambassador is offline. It also provides features for wish recipients to connect and chat with program alumni, upload files, track application status, and manage their to-do lists.

## How to run the application

1. Install the latest version of vite using npm
   `npm i vite@latest`

2. Install the app's dependencies:
   `npm install`

3. Start the development server:
   `npm run dev`

This will launch the application and make it accessible on your local development environment.
